Test an user triggered service removal from a previously active HA stack, which
should make the LRM and the CRM go idle and dropping the lock once enough
cycles passed without any new service.

We use some delays to stall execution, as else we'd exit the test-simulation
earlier than the 90 rounds idle time required before the CRM gives up their
lock and watchdog.
