Test an user triggered service removal from a previously active HA stack, which
should make the LRM and the CRM go idle and dropping the lock once enough
cycles passed without any new service.

BUT, unlike in the going-idle1 test we trigger some CRM commands to see if that
delays going idle. Add quite some extra delays after the CRM command to also
track long-term behavior so that we can, e.g., ensure that the state is not
flapping between idle and active.
